// ### Key Points:
// 1. **Default Export**: The `Section` component is exported as the default export from the module, making it available for import in other files.
// 2. **Destructured Props**: The component takes an object of props and destructures it into `title`, `children`, and `otherProps`.
// 3. **JSX Structure**: The component returns a `section` element containing an `h2` heading and the `children` elements.
// 4. **Dynamic Content**: The `title` prop is displayed within the `h2` element, and the `children` prop is used to render any nested elements passed to the `Section` component.
// 5. **Spread Operator**: The `...otherProps` syntax spreads the remaining props onto the `section` element. This allows additional properties such as `id`, `className`, or any other HTML attributes to be applied to the `section` element.
// 6. **Reusability**: This structure makes the `Section` component highly reusable, as it can wrap and display various content passed as children, with customizable attributes through `otherProps`.
