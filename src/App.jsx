// ### Key Points:
// 1. **Component Imports**: The `Header`, `CoreConcepts`, and `Examples` components are imported from their respective file paths.
// 2. **App Component**: The main functional component of the application that uses other components to build the UI.
// 3. **Commented Console Log**: A console log statement is commented out, which could be used for debugging purposes to log when the `App` component executes.
// 4. **React Fragments**: `<></>` are used to group multiple JSX elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
// 5. **Header Component**: Rendered at the top of the `App` component.
// 6. **main Element**: Contains the primary content of the application, including the `CoreConcepts` and `Examples` components.
// 7. **Default Export**: The `App` component is exported as the default export from the module, making it the main component that can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
